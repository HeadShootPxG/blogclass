      <!-- INTRO -->
      <section>
        <p>
          I have to be honest: I’m not a big reader.
          I would like to read more, but usually I only pick up a book when something really
          catch my eye. And most of the time, the first thing I look at is the cover.
        </p>
        <p>
          People always say “Don’t judge a book by its cover.” Well I dothis.
          Maybe it’s because I don’t read so much, so the cover help me decide very fast
          if the book looks interesting or maybe too difficult for me.
        </p>

      <!-- WHAT ATTRACTS ME -->
      <section>
        <h2>What Attracts Me</h2>

        <h3>The Cover</h3>
        <p>
          I prefer covers that are simple and clean. Soft colours, drawings or something
          a bit artistic make me more curious. When a cover is very dark or super busy,
          it already give me a bad feeling and I don’t even touch the book.
        </p>

        <h3>The Font</h3>
        <p>
          Fonts are important for me. Big bold letters look too serious or even a little
          aggressive sometimes. I like when the title looks friendly or kind of written by hand,
          because then the book look more easy to read.
        </p>

        <h3>The Size</h3>
        <p>
          Thick books really scare me. When I see a huge novel, I feel tired already
          before I open it. Small or medium books are more ok for me, especially because
          I don’t read a lot in my free time.
        </p>

        <h3>The Author’s Name</h3>
        <p>
          I don’t have very strong opinion about authors, but sometimes when the name
          is only initials it looks more professional or serious. I don’t really judge
          by gender, I just see if the name sound a bit familiar or not.
        </p>
      </section>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <!-- OTHER FACTORS -->
      <section>
        <h2>Other Things I Look At</h2>
        <p>
          Because I’m not a strong reader, I usually choose books that I think I can
          really enjoy and understand without getting lost.
        </p>
        <ul class="simple-list">
          <li><strong>Genre:</strong> I prefer simple fiction with clear stories.</li>
          <li><strong>Format:</strong> graphic novels or books with pictures are more attractive for me.</li>
          <li><strong>Audience:</strong> young adult books feel more easy and less stressful.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <!-- BOOKS -->
      <section>
        <h2>Books That Surprised Me</h2>
        <p>
          Even if I don’t read a lot, some books still surprised me a bit, in good
          and sometimes in strange ways. Here are three examples.
        </p>

        <div class="books-grid">

          <!-- Book 1 -->
          <div class="book-card">
            <div class="book-cover">
              <img
                src="https://cdn2.penguin.com.au/covers/original/9780141185620.jpg"
                alt="The Little Prince">
            </div>
            <div class="book-text">
              <div class="book-note">Example 1 :</div>
              <h4>The Little Prince</h4>
              <p>
                At first, the cover looked very childish to me, like it was just for small kids.
                So I didn’t really want to read it.
              </p>
              <p class="book-lesson">
                But when I finally read it, the story was beautiful and also very deep.
                It showed me that a simple cover can hide a really strong and emotional story.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- Book 2 -->
          <div class="book-card">
            <div class="book-cover">
              <img
                src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615ewwnsdIL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg"
                alt="Diary of a Wimpy Kid">
            </div>
            <div class="book-text">
              <div class="book-note">Example 2 :</div>
              <h4>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</h4>
              <p>
                I chose this book because of the funny cartoon style on the cover.
                It looks light, modern and not too serious, so I thought, “Ok, this one is for me.”
              </p>
              <p class="book-lesson">
                The drawings and the simple language made it really easy to follow.
                It helped me see that reading can be fun and not always hard work.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- Book 3 -->
          <div class="book-card">
            <div class="book-cover">
              <img
                src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/One_of_Us_is_Lying_book_cover.jpg/250px-One_of_Us_is_Lying_book_cover.jpg"
                alt="One of Us Is Lying">
            </div>
            <div class="book-text">
              <div class="book-note">Example 3 :</div>
              <h4>One of Us Is Lying</h4>
              <p>
                The cover looked very dramatic, with big red letters and serious faces.
                First I thought it was too intense and probably too difficult for me.
              </p>
              <p class="book-lesson">
                But the story was fast and exciting, and I really wanted to know who was the killer.
                This book taught me that sometimes a cover that looks a bit scary or too serious
                can still hide a story I actually enjoy.

      <!-- LEARNING -->
      <section>
        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>After thinking about all this, I realize some things about my own reading:</p>
        <ul class="simple-list">
          <li>I depend a lot on covers because I am not a regular reader.</li>
          <li>I get quickly scared by long or very serious-looking books.</li>
          <li>Sometimes a book I don’t expect much from becomes one of the best ones for me.</li>
          <li>A friendly and simple cover makes reading feel more possible for me.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- ENDING -->
      <section>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          I still judge books by their covers, but now I try to be a little bit more open.
          I know that sometimes the story is much better than the appearance outside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe one day I will read more regular. But for now, I have to admit:
          yes, the cover is still the first thing that convince me.
